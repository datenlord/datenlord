Few notes on how to use fstest in short steps:

	# cd fstest
	# vi tests/conf
	Change 'fs' to file system type you want to test. These can be:
	UFS, ZFS, ext3, ntfs-3g and xfs.
	# vi Makefile
	You may need to manually tweak few things by editing CFLAGS lines
	at the top of the file.
	# make
	It will compile fstest utility which is used by regression tests.
	# cd /path/to/file/system/you/want/to/test/
	The test must be run as root user.
	# prove -r /path/to/fstest/

That's all. Enjoy.
